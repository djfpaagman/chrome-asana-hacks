# Chrome Asana Hacks

This small extension is here to increase your Asana productivity, it:

* Introduces "Silent mode", which removes the unread inbox notifications
* Introduces an "Inbox" switch, which completely hides your inbox so you can focus on work
* Introduces "meeting mode", which reduces visual clutter when using Asana in meetings

Next to that, the extension:

* Makes private tasks more prominent with a red background, making sure you never accidentaly create private tasks anymore.
* Makes project and tags in the task list more clear (wider) on large screens.

## Installation
Get the extension [through the Chrome web store][1] or clone the repository and [load it as an unpacked extension][2].

## Changelog

* Meeting mode now also automatically toggles the header and toggles the sidebar.

### 0.6
